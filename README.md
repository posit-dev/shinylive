Shinylive
==========

Code for deploying Shiny applications that will run completely in the browser, using Pyodide (Python compiled to WebAssembly).

* Current semi-stable version (deployed from `deploy` branch of this repo): https://shinylive.io/py/examples/
* Latest dev version (deployed from `main` branch of this repo): https://rstudio.github.io/shinylive/examples/

## Prerequisites

`Shinylive` leverages `yarn` for dependency management. If running `yarn --version` on the machine throws `command not found` error,
install `yarn` on the machine by following the yarn installation documentation [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install)


## Build instructions

You must first initialize the git submodules. This only needs to be done once:

```bash
make submodules
```

After that, you can simply run `make all`:

```bash
make all
```

To build and serve the live Examples page:

```bash
make serve
```

This will also watch the source files in `src/` for changes, and will rebuild and auto-reload the web page when the files change.

To build the shinylive.tar.gz distribution file:

```bash
make dist
```


There is also a Quarto web site which demonstrates the shinylive components in different configurations. To build and serve the test Quarto web site with Quarto components:

```bash
make quarto
make quartoserve
```

This will auto-rebuild and reload the Quarto site when a .qmd file in `quarto/` changes, but it will not auto-rebuild when the source TS files change.


You may occasionally need to clean out the built artifacts and rebuild:

```sh
make clean
make submodules
make all
```


You can see many of the `make` targets by just running `make`:

```

## Pulling changes

After pulling changes to the parent repo, you may need to tell it to update submodules.

```bash
git pull
make submodules
```

## Adding new packages

If you add a package to `shinylive_requirements.json`, the lockfile must also be regenerated:

```
make update_packages_lock
```
