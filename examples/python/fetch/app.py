# Normally in Python, you would use urllib.request.urlopen() to fetch data from a web
# API. However, it won't work in Pyodide because sockets are not available.
#
# Instead, you can pyodide.http.pyfetch(), which is a wrapper for the JavaScript fetch()
# function. Note that when running shinylive, the endpoint MUST use https. This is
# because shinylive must be served over https (unless you are running on localhost),
# and browsers will not allow a https page to fetch data with http.
#
# If you are fetching data from a different origin, that server will also need to allow
# cross-origin requests by setting the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header. See
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing for more information.
#
# If you see "Failed to fetch" in the Python console, it is likely because the endpoint
# is http and not https, or because the server does not allow cross-origin requests.
#
# One important difference between urllib.request.urlopen() and pyodide.http.pyfetch()
# is that the latter is asynchronous. In a Shiny app, this just means that the
# reactive.Calc's and outputs must have `async` in front of the function definitions,
# and when they're called, they must have `await` in front of them.
#
# If you want to write code that works in both regular Python and Pyodide, see the
# download.py file for a wrapper function that can be used to make requests in both
# regular Python and Pyodide. (Note that the function isn't actually used in this app.)
