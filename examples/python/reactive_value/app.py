# When a reactive Value's value changes, it will invalidate (and trigger re-execution)
# of any reactive objects (Calcs, Effects, and outputs) that depend on it. Typically, a
# reactive Value will be set with a reactive Effect. The Effect, in turn, may be driven
# by a user input (like a button), or something else, like a timer.
#
# Reactive Values are often used for tracking or accumulating state over time.
#
# In this example, a button press triggers an Effect which adds the current timestamp to
# a reactive Value containing an array of timestamps. Importantly, the Effect sets the
# reactive Value's value, which causes all downstream reactive objects to be
# invalidated.
#
# There is also an output which reads the reactive Value and returns a string. When the
# reactive Value changes, it invalidates this output, causing it to re-execute and
# return a new string.
